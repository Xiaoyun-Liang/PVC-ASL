# PVC-ASL
Partial volume correction using modified least trimmed squares (PVC-mLTS) is a software toolbox that can be employed to correct 
partial volume effect for single inversion-time ASL data.
The method is described in the following paper:

labeling data. Magn Reson Med. 2013 Feb;69(2):531-7. doi: 10.1002/mrm.24279.
